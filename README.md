# Multi-Class-Logistic-Regression


This project implements a Multiclass Logistic Regression classifier using the One-vs-Rest (OvR) strategy. The OvR method allows you to tackle multiclass classification problems by breaking them down into multiple binary classification tasks.


## Key Characteristics

- **One-vs-Rest Strategy**: Converts a multiclass problem into multiple binary classification subproblems.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Standardizing the features to prepare the input data.
- **Sigmoid Activation**: Utilizes the sigmoid (logistic) activation function to estimate class probabilities.
- **Batch Gradient Descent**: Optimizes model parameters using batch gradient descent, minimizing the logistic loss function.
